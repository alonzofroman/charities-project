# myCharitySearch

## Project description 
The purpose of this site is to create a site that features a search function for both local and global charities for the user. We have a dynamically updating carousel of featured charities, and utilize two seperate APIs to search by city name or by charity theme. For local results, we utilized the Charity Navigator API and searched for charities by city name. For global results, we used the Global Giving API and searched for charities by themes, such as education or refugee rights. Once a call is made, results are displayed as list elements and display both charity name and location. Selecting a charity from the list takes the user to a dynamically generated single charity page that features the respective charity's name, mission statement, available images, URL, and a Google Map object displaying its location.
